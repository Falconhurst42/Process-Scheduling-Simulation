# Process Scheduler Simulation
This program is designed to simulate a OS scheduling system and gather information about the performance of different strategies.

## Quick Start
The functions from the `benchmark.h` library manage running a simulation and return the gathered statistics. The statistics classes are defined in `stat.h`. Each class has print and export methods to display or save the information.

The `timeline.ipynb` Jupyter notebook includes Python code to generate a variety of charts from the exported data.
